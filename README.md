#Amazon 1-Click Lock

**Amazon 1-Click Lock** does a couple of things:
- Protects the 1-Click button from product pages to prevent accidental clicks, now it requires two clicks.
- Completely removes the 1-click buttons from product browsing pages, to buy anything it is necessary to go through the products page first.

Should work with most Amazon domains, if you are presented with any problem, contact me and I'll try to solve it.
